How to Be a Fearless Presenter

You would think that Adele---whose recent album, 25, sold more than 3 million copies in the U.S. in its debut week---wouldn't have any problems with nerves before she performs.

You'd be wrong.

In an interview, Adele explained what she typically does before going onstage: "I puke quite a lot."

It's natural to be nervous when you give a presentation. I've been giving presentations for over twenty years and I'm still nervous for about the first thirty seconds every time I stand up in front of an audience.

Is presenting like jumping out of an airplane or like ballroom dancing?

There's a fascinating study that was done. Researchers took people who had never parachuted before and took measurements of their cortisol levels (a measure of stress) before and after they jumped. Before they jumped, their cortisol levels were raised to an extremely high level. After the jumped, the researchers measured again. And made the subjects jump again. After the second jump, their cortisol levels were half of what they were the first time. The researchers measured again. And made the subjects jump again. After the third jump, the cortisol levels dropped in half again.

In other words, as scary as it was to jump out of an airplane three times, risking death, people were one-fourth as stressed as they were before they jumped.

The researchers followed the same protocol to test stress levels of competitive ballroom dancers. Their findings? Competitive ballroom dancers were just as stressed every time they competed as they were the time before.

So. Is presenting more like jumping out of an airplane or like competitive ballroom dancing?

It's maybe a little bit of both. If you're not used to presenting, the good news is you'll feel more comfortable presenting every time you do it. But if your presentation is a pitch, a win/loose situation, a winner takes all situation, it may feel more like competitive ballroom dancing.

How do you manage the stress of ballroom dancing?

Here's how to prepare for your presentation like a competitive ballroom dancer.

Here's how to be more confident when you present.

Watch your self-talk.

What are you saying to yourself about presenting?

What if...?

What if they don't like me? What if they do?

What if I forget what I was going to say? What if you don't?

What if they don't like my presentation? What if they do?

Here's what I say: I've done this a thousand times before. I know I'm good. They're going to be interested in this. This is going to be fun and they're going to learn a lot. It's going to be great.

Practice, practice, practice.

The more familiar you are with your presentation, the more comfortable you'll be. But don't try to memorize it. If you try to memorize it, what happens when you're presenting and you forget what you were going to say? You'll stumble and become even more nervous. Trying to memorize a presentation word for word is a mistake. If your presentation sounds memorized, it would come across as authentically. It will sound like it's coming from your head instead of your heart.

Remember the last time you took a vacation? What happened when you came back to work and people asked you about your vacation?

You didn't have to think about what to say because you just drew on your experience. When the next person asked you about your vacation, you told them pretty much the same story. Maybe you left something out that you told the first person that wasn't that interesting, or you added a little story about something fun that you forgot, or you embellished a little bit.

By the time you tell the third person, you're telling pretty much the same story. You may even be using some of the same words or phrases.

By the time you tell the fourth person or the fifth, the story is rolling off your tongue. You're not thinking about it, but it's pretty much the same story with your favorite phrases. You're not forgetting to talk about anything you think is interesting and it's sounding like you're telling the story for the first time. You've memorized it without memorizing it and it's coming from your heart, not your head.

But here's the trick: you can't tell the story without first having the experience.

So what's the experience? What if you're presenting from a PowerPoint deck?

You have to go on vacation. You have to go through the deck, through each slide, and have the experience. You have to find your path through each slide.

Take your presentation and print out the slides. Then draw a 1 with a circle around it on your first point on the slide, then a line to the second point (draw a 2 with a circle around that), then a line to the third point, if you have one (and number that one). If you have more than three things to highlight on the slide, redesign the slide. A slide should actually only make one point, but you might have two or three highlights.

Now you know the path through the slide, explain it as simply as you can. Go through the slide several times. Each time you go through it, try telling the story in a slightly different way. Eventually, you'll find the way of saying it that sounds right---captures your key points and makes them in a compelling way---and, just as importantly, feels right. When you say the words, they flow from you're mouth. You're not working against yourself.

If you're rehearsing your presentation and you keep stumbling over the same words or phrases, you're working against yourself. Find a different way to express your point. Keep practicing until it feels right.

When things feel right, you'll feel more confident. And confidence is courage.

Once you've taken the vacation through your slides, know the outline and the essence. First we went here and then we went there. This was the takeaway here and this was the takeaway there.

Having said all of the above, there are actually two things you do want to memorize word-for-word: your opening and your closing.

Why?

You have to understand the way your audience's attention will fluctuate during your presentation. You'll have their attention at the beginning because they don't yet know what you're going to say. They'll perk up to see whether or not you're worth paying attention to. And they'll perk up at the end of your presentation, too, because when you're done it's probably time to go to lunch or to go home or to the next meeting.

If you're nervous when you start, you'll likely stumble out of the gate and that will just make you more nervous. And you'll probably be so relieved when your presentation is almost over that you'll botch the close. If your presentation is a pitch, you won't be confident when you make your ask, or you'll forget to make your ask at all.

Manage your instrument.

Actors talk about their body and their voice as their instrument. I'm not suggesting that you act when you present---actually, I recommend the exact opposite---but you need to think about your body and your voice in the same way. Aside from your slides, it's all you've got to work with.

You're nervous when you first start to present because you've got one foot on the gas and one foot on the brakes. You're not scared, you're excited. You have all this anticipation, all this energy, and it has no where to go. You have to give it somewhere to go. You have to let it move.

How do you move it?

You can move it by breathing, and by moving your body. Just take a few purposeful steps, or use your hands. If you don't naturally talk with your hands, think about using your hands to serve up your words and help them get out into your audience. Your palms are open and up and your gestures are flowing out toward your audience. This will make you look open and comfortable.

Create good content.

I work with investment bankers and CEO's who make pitches with densely packed slides full of financial information or technical details. They rarely make for good storytelling. One of the biggest challenges they face when they start to present is that they have to work against their slides. They can't not have the detail in there, but when they try to talk their way through it, the slides are a distraction.

The solution is to eliminate everything you possibly can. Replace the detail with the takeaway, if possible.

Prime yourself right before you start.

You've done a lot of preparation before you get to your presentation. You're almost on. Now you want to prime yourself. James Altucher listens to comedians before he goes onstage. Some people listen to rock music.

Here are a few ways to prime yourself:

Try some power poses.

Watch the TED talk by Amy Cuddy (http://www.ted.com/talks/amy\_cuddy\_your\_body\_language\_shapes\_who\_you\_are).

Visualize success.

Before I present, I always picture it going well. I imagine the audience coming up afterward and thanking me.

Warm up.

Loosen up your body and your voice. Hum. Sing. I recite Jabberwocky. I can do it as a lounge lizard, pretentious poet, rockabilly...I just play with the words to loosen up my voice and relax.

Breathe.

Take a few deep breaths into your belly. If you take a deep breath into your belly and bear down, you'll trigger an autonomic?? reflex in your vagus nerve that will calm you down.

Arrive early and test one, two, three.

Get to a venue early and become familiar with the space. Find out where everything is. Test your equipment. Things can always go wrong, but the more familiar and comfortable you are with the space, and knowing the tech has been tested, will help you to relax.

We can't sleep in strange places because we can't sleep with one eye open. The more familiar you are with a place the easier it is to sleep, that is, to relax. So familiarize yourself with the venue.

Make friends.

Ever noticed how most people are hesitant to sit in the front row when they arrive at a venue for a presentation?

Another advantage to getting to a venue early is to make friends with the audience as they're coming in. Introduce yourself. Making even a little bit of contact will help set you at ease. And because they now feel more comfortable, too, they're more likely to sit in the front. When you start your presentation, just look out at the friendlies in the front row and make eye contact with them. They're on your side. They're rooting for you.

Drink. Water.

Tim Ferris recommends drinking Coke. If that works for you, fine. I don't recommend alcohol, though. If you're looking for something to calm your nerves or ease your social anxiety, try GABA, Valerian Root, or L-Theanine.

Finally, remember that's it's okay to be nervous.

Really. I'm not suggesting you fake being nervous, but showing a little vulnerability can get your audience on your side. It humanizes you. If you're too cocky confident, you can come across as conceited. Sure, it depends on what you're talking about. If you're making a financial presentation and you're nervous, your audience might read it as if you're trying to cover something up.

Manage yourself when you're on.

Now that you're presenting, manage yourself in the moment. Here's how:

Believe in yourself.

Feel yourself. Use your instrument. Keep your energy moving.

Relax

You can push on a wall, like Yul Brenner used to do before going onstage. Pushing on a wall tenses and relaxes your muscles.

Smile and have fun.

Smiling will relax you and relax your audience. This isn't brain surgery. Nobody's died (unless they have). Unless you're delivering bad news, it's okay to smile.

In my experience, women tend to smile too much and men tend not to smile enough. You can be chatting with a guy and he's friendly and lively, but as soon as he stands up to present, he's grim and serious. Don't be.

For women, I think they tend to overdo smiles as a way of taking the edge off. If they're too serious, they may be viewed as too masculine. There's a balance. So be careful not to smile nervously, but a sincere smile always works.

Focus on your audience.

The reason you feel nervous when you stand up to present is because you're self-conscious. You are literally focusing on yourself. You're worried about embarrassing yourself, of screwing up, forgetting your lines, wondering if your zipper is open.

The solution is simple: get your attention outside of yourself. Look at your audience. Really look. Make eye contact. You should always feel like you're actually talking to someone, one person, no matter how many people are in your audience. When you make eye contact with someone, really feel that you're making contact. You're having a real conversation with one person, even if there are five hundred people in the audience (you might have to use your imagination).

Be yourself. Only better.

But never be afraid to be yourself. Just be your best self.
