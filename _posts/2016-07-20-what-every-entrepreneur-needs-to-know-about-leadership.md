What Every Entrepreneur Needs to Know About Leadership

One of the most common reasons startups fail, after lack of product market fit, is because of people issues.

You're contagious.

The people in your company are going to look to you to take the temperature of the company. However you feel, your team is likely to feel. If you're discouraged, even before you say anything, you're team will likely feel discouraged. If you're excited, your team will be excited.

What signals are you sending?

That doesn't mean everyone knows what you know.

You may know where you're going and where you want to take the company, but the rest of your team won't know unless you tell them. Worse, if you don't tell them, they'll make something up. Probably the wrong thing.

If you want everyone to go in the same direction, you need to tell them where they're going.

It does mean you have to be careful what you say.

If you have a problem with someone on your team, you can't talk to another person on your team about them or they'll wonder what you're saying about them when you talk to everyone else.

Depending on the problem, you may not want to talk to your investors or your board. So who do you talk to?

Have a support network. Mentors outside of your company, other entrepreneurs, an executive coach.

You're the keeper of the culture.

And culture is critical. Think of culture as a kind of seed. When your company is new and your team is small (maybe it's only you, or you and a co-founder), you should think about the kind of culture you want to create.

When you hire, make sure you hire for cultural fit, not just technical talent.

Managing others starts with managing yourself.

Focus on what really matters.

You will always have to prioritize and to help your team prioritize. Focus on what's important.

What's that?

Getting the right people on the bus.

Product/market fit.

Money. That could be fundraising or, better yet, making profits.

Know what to say "No" to.

You can say yes to everything. You have to be able to set limits.
